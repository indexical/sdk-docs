title: Input Many
---

import { OptionsTable } from "/snippets/OptionsTable.mdx";

The `inputMany` Transform starts with the input State and produces a **set** of output States such that each output State is the input State information added about ways to interact with the webpage represented by the input State. The output States **collectively** accomplish the goal provided (see example below).

## Example

```ts
import { inputMany } from "indexical/dist/web";

const myTransform = inputMany({
  goal: "Try every possible city in the drop-down",
});
```

## Available Options

<OptionsTable
  rows={[
    {
      name: "goal",
      required: true,
      type: "string",
      description: "A natural language goal for the AI to try to achieve.",
    },
  ]}
/>
