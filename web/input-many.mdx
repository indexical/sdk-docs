# Action: `input-many`

The `input-many` action starts with the input State and produces a **set** of output States such that each output State is the input State with an [Interaction](/interactions) added, and the output States **collectively** accomplish the goal (see example below).

This action is currently considered experimental and primarily works in scenarios involving `<select>` inputs.

## Example

```json
{
  "action": "input-many",
  "goal": "Try every possible city in the drop-down"
}
```

## Available Options

(See also the Universal Options in the [Actions](/actions) top-level Documentation)

<OptionsTable
  rows={[
    {
      name: "goal",
      required: true,
      type: "string",
      default: null,
      description: "A natural language goal for the AI to try to achieve.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Relevant [Locators](/locators)
