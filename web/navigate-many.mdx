# Action: `navigate-many`

The `navigate-many` action will select all the links on the current page that align with the provided `goal`, and output a new State for each one. If the current page includes pagination, this step will attempt to automatically interact as required to flip through the pages.

This action can also be used to 'manually' create new states via the `urls` option.

## Example

```json
{
  "action": "navigate-many",
  "goal": "Find the links to all the profiles"
}
```

## Available Options

          If the page involves pagination, this option introduces a delay after
          loading each page of the pagination. If pagination is especially slow,
          this can make sure no items are missed. Can be a number (ms), or a
          pair of numbers [min, max].

## Relevant [Locators](/locators)

The `navgate-many` action can utilize a [Locator](/locators) with the special key `"$link"` to identify all the link elements (i.e. `<a>` elements) on the page that should be followed.

Additionally, the special key `"$next"` can be used to indicate an element that should be clicked to move to the next page of results, in situations involving pagination.

Additionally, the special key `"$scroll"` can be used when the `scroll` option is `true`, to specify the element to scroll.
