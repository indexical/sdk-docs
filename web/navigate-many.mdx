title: Navigate Many
---

import { OptionsTable } from "/snippets/OptionsTable.mdx";

The `navigateMany` Transform will select all the links on the current page that align with the provided `goal`, and output a new State for each one. If the current page includes pagination, this step will attempt to automatically interact as required to flip through the pages.

## Example

```ts
import { navigateMany } from "indexical/dist/web";

const myTransform = navigateMany({
  goal: "Find the links to all the profiles",
});
```

## Available Options

<OptionsTable
  rows={[
    {
      name: "goal",
      required: true,
      type: "string",
      description: "A natural language goal for the AI to try to achieve.",
    },
    {
      name: "validation",
      required: false,
      type: "object (see below)",
      description: (
        <>Validate the step's output set using these criteria (see below)</>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "validation.size.min",
      required: false,
      type: "number",
      default: 0,
      description: (
        <>Fail the step unless it produces at least this many output states</>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "delay",
      required: false,
      type: "number or [number, number]",
      default: 0,
      description: (
        <>
          If the page involves pagination, this option introduces a delay after
          loading each page of the pagination. If pagination is especially slow,
          this can make sure no items are missed. Can be a number (ms), or a
          pair of numbers [min, max].
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "scroll",
      required: false,
      type: "boolean",
      default: false,
      description: (
        <>
          This option, when true, will attempt to auto-trigger any scroll-based
          listeners or infinite-scroll-style pagination while identifying all
          links to follow.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "limit",
      required: false,
      type: "number",
      description: <>Only select at most this number of links to output.</>,
    },
    {
      name: "paths",
      required: false,
      type: <>string[]</>,
      description:
        "Output states with the provided paths,relative to the input state's URL.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Relevant [Strategies](/start/strategies)

The `navgateMany` Transform can utilize a [Strategy](/start/strategies) with the special key `"$link"` to identify all the link elements (i.e. `<a>` elements) on the page that should be followed.

Additionally, the special key `"$next"` can be used to indicate an element that should be clicked to move to the next page of results, in situations involving pagination.

Additionally, the special key `"$scroll"` can be used when the `scroll` option is `true`, to specify the element to scroll.
