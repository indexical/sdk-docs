# Action: `navigate`

The `navigate` action will start at the input State and follow a link on the page that our AI believes will get it closer to the stated `goal`. It will then repeat this process until either it believes the `goal` has been reached or it hits the maximum number of `hops` specified as an option.

This action can also be used to 'manually' navigate by manipulating/constructing a URL as a string.

## Example

```json
{
  "action": "navigate",
  "goal": "Find a contact page",
  "hops": {
    "max": 3
  }
}
```

## Available Options

(See also the Universal Options in the [Actions](/actions) top-level Documentation)
