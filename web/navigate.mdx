title: Navigate
---

import { OptionsTable } from "/snippets/OptionsTable.mdx";

The `navigate` Transform will start at the input State and follow a link on the page that it believes will get it closer to the stated `goal` (using an LLM). It will then repeat this process until either it believes the `goal` has been reached or it hits the maximum number of `hops` specified as an option. The final url is used for the output State.

## Example

```ts
import { navigate } from "indexical/dist/web";

const myTransform = navigate({
  goal: "Find a contact page",
  hops: {
    max: 3,
  },
});
```

## Available Options

<OptionsTable
  rows={[
    {
      name: "goal",
      required: true,
      type: "string",
      description: "A natural language goal for the AI to try to achieve.",
    },
    {
      name: "hops",
      required: false,
      type: "object (see below)",
      description: <>(see below)</>,
    },
    {
      name: "hops.max",
      required: false,
      type: "number",
      default: 10,
      description: (
        <>
          Set the maximum number of times to try following links before giving
          up.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "pattern",
      required: false,
      type: "string",
      description: (
        <>
          Specify a regular expression that the final URL reached should conform
          to.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "try",
      required: false,
      type: "string[]",
      description: (
        <>
          Provide relative paths in this array, and the Indexical AI will try
          those paths in order until it finds one that does not result in an
          HTTP error, and then will start navigating from that path instead of
          from the URL in in the input State.
        </>
      ),
    },
