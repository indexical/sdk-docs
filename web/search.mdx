# Action: `search`

The `search` action uses Indexical's Search Engine integration to execute a search query, then creates output States from the results. It supports a standard set of [advanced search operators](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) that can be used to craft more specific queries.

This action is useful for finding information on the web, but it can also be very useful for finding information on a single domain, as shown in the example below (which relies on [Special Values](/values)).

Note that pipelines using the `search` action often take `textInputs` as the input in their [Runs](/runs), instead of `urls`. See the [Runs](/runs) documentation's table of options for more details.

## Examples

This example uses the URL of the Input [State](/states) to limit the search to a specific site/domain. This can be a quick & cost-effective way to find information on a website, as an alternative to the [Navigate Action](/actions/navigate):

```json
{
  "action": "search",
  "query": "$: Pricing site:$url",
  "limit": 1
}
```

This example uses data provided via `textInputs` in the Run specification (see [Runs](/runs) for more detail), which becomes available in the State's `data.input` variable. If this variable is present and no `query` is provided, the value of `data.input` is used as the query. Here, we instead use it to construct a more complicated query.

```json
{
  "action": "search",
  "limit": 1,
  "query": "$: Terms of Service for $data.input"
}
```

The [Run](/runs) for the pipeline containing the above step (here names `tos-finder`) might look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "tos-finder",
  "textInputs": ["OpenAI", "Apple", "Facebook"]
}
```

Note that a Run must contain _either_ `textInputs` _or_ `urls`, never both.

Both of the examples above use the String Templating Special Value, see [Special Values](/values) for more information.

## Relevant [Locators](/locators)

The `search` action does not currently support any manually-provided Locators.
