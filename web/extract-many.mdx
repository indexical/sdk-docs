# Action: `extract-many`

The `extract-many` action is a specialized version of `extract` that will generate **multiple** JSON datastructures from the current page, all using the same provided schema. It's appropriate when you would like to extract all instances of a certain data structure from a page. If the current page includes pagination, this step will attempt to automatically interact as required to flip through the pages.

The behavior of `extract-many` can be roughly duplicated by using `extract` with a schema containing an array of objects, but this will likely perform substantially worse due to a lack of optimizations.

## Example

```json
{
  "action": "extract-many",
  "goal": "Get details on all the books listed on the page",
  "schema": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Book title"
    },
    "price": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Book price in USD"
    }
  }
}
```

          like to merge the output of multiple steps, use mergeOn in each
          subsequent step. If 'write' is false, this option has no effect.

## Relevant [Locators](/locators)

The `extract-many` action can utilize [Locators](/locators) that have a `key` corresponding to a `key` in the action's `schema`.

Additionally, the special key `"$container"` can be used in a Locator to indicate a set of elements that have a 1:1 correspondence with the desired output, i.e. where each instance of the element contains all the data for one desired instance of the output.

Additionally, the special key `"$next"` can be used to indicate an element that should be clicked to move to the next page of results, in situations involving pagination.

Additionally, the special key `"$scroll"` can be used when the `scroll` option is `true`, to specify the element to scroll.
