title: Extract Many
---

import { OptionsTable } from "/snippets/OptionsTable.mdx";

The `extractMany` Transform is a specialized version of `extract` that will generate & write **multiple** JSON datastructures from the current page, all using the same provided schema. It's appropriate when you would like to extract all instances of a certain data structure from a page. If the current page includes pagination, this step will attempt to automatically interact as required to flip through the pages.

## Example

```ts
import { extractMany } from "indexical/dist/web";

const myTransform = extractMany({
  goal: "Get details on all the books listed on the page",
  schema: {
    title: {
      type: "string",
      description: "Book title",
    },
    price: {
      type: "number",
      description: "Book price in USD",
    },
  },
});
```

## Available Options

<OptionsTable
  rows={[
    {
      name: "goal",
      required: true,
      type: "string",
      description: "A natural language goal for the AI to try to achieve.",
    },
    {
      name: "schema",
      required: true,
      type: <>object</>,
      description: (
        <>A JSON Schema defining the desired output data structure</>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "validation",
      required: false,
      type: "object (see below)",
      default: "",
      description: (
        <>Validate the step's output set using these criteria (see below)</>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "validation.required",
      required: false,
      type: "string[]",
      default: [],
      description: (
        <>
          Discard an output unless it has all the keys specified in the provided
          array.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "scroll",
      required: false,
      type: "boolean",
      default: false,
      description: (
        <>
          This option, when true, will attempt to auto-trigger any scroll-based
          listeners or infinite-scroll-style pagination while
          paginating/extracting.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "deduplicate",
      required: false,
      type: "boolean",
      default: false,
      description: (
        <>
          This option, when true, will deduplicate extracted results so that
          only unique results are output.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "delay",
      required: false,
      type: "number or [number, number]",
      default: 0,
      description: (
        <>
          If the page involves pagination, this option introduces a delay after
          loading each page of the pagination. If pagination is especially slow,
          this can make sure no items are missed. Can be a number (ms), or a
          pair of numbers [min, max].
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "limit",
      required: false,
      type: "number",
      description: <>Only generate at-most this many output objects</>,
    },
    {
      name: "mode",
      required: false,
      type: '"textual" or "visual"',
      default: "textual",
      description: (
        <>
          Whether to process the current page as text or as an image when
          attempting to extract/analyze data. Typically, "textual" provides the
          best results, but "visual" can be necessary if data is present in
          graphics or for particularly complicated layouts. "visual" is used by
          default for PDFs.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "write",
      required: false,
      type: "boolean",
      default: true,
      description: (
        <>
          Whether or not to write the extracted data to the results datastore.
          Regardless of the value of this option, the data will be stored in the
          `data` of output States.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "mergeOn",
      required: false,
      type: "string",
      description: (
        <>
          When a key name is provided for this option (and the 'write' option is
          true), the output will be merged with the output generated from the
          prior step that has the same value for the provided key. If you would
          like to merge the output of multiple steps, use mergeOn in each
          subsequent step. If 'write' is false, this option has no effect.
        </>
      ),
    },

## Relevant [Strategies](/start/strategies)

The `extractMany` Transform can utilize [Strategies](/start/strategies) that have a `key` corresponding to a `key` in the provided `schema`.

Additionally, the special key `"$container"` can be used in a Strategy to indicate a set of elements that have a 1:1 correspondence with the desired output, i.e. where each instance of the element contains all the data for one desired instance of the output.

Additionally, the special key `"$next"` can be used to indicate an element that should be clicked to move to the next page of results, in situations involving pagination.

Additionally, the special key `"$scroll"` can be used when the `scroll` option is `true`, to specify the element to scroll.
