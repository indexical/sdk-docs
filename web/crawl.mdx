import { OptionsTable } from "/snippets/OptionsTable.mdx";

The `crawl` Transform will load the URL of the Input State and attempt to find all URLs reachable from this state. It will then output an Output State for each URL that was found. This Transform does not have any AI/LLM functionality. The `mode` option (as well as the `pattern` option and `limit` option) can be used to specify a strategy for controlling which URLs are included in the crawl.

## Example

This example will crawl the Input State's URL, following only URLs that have the same host (i.e. domain and subdomain) as the Input State:

```ts
import { crawl } from "indexical/dist/web";

const myTransform = crawl({
  mode: "host",
});
```

## Options

<OptionsTable
  rows={[
    {
      name: "mode",
      required: false,
      type: '"domain" or "host" or "all"',
      default: "domain",
      description: (
        <>
          If "domain" (default): only follow/crawl URLs that share the same main
          domain as the input (i.e. 'indexical.dev' in
          'https://blog.indexical.dev/posts/sonnet_gpt4').
          <br />
          <br />
          If "host": only follow/crawl URLs that share the same host (subdomain and
          domain) as the input (i.e. 'blog.indexical.dev' in 'https://blog.indexical.dev/posts/sonnet_gpt4')
          <br />
          <br />
          If "any": all links are followed.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "pattern",
      required: false,
      type: "string (RegExp)",
      default: ".*",
      description: (
        <>
          Only follow/crawl URLs that match the provided regular expression.
          This can be combined with the 'mode' option.{" "}
          <b>
            NOTE: URLs that don't match the provided pattern will not be
            followed/loaded, even as intermediate states when crawling.
          </b>
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: "limit",
      required: false,
      type: "number",
      default: "",
      description: (
        <>Only generate at-most this many output states (unique URLs)</>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Relevant [Locators](/start/locators)

The `crawl` Transform does not currently support any manually-provided Locators.
