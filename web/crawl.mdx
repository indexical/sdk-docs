# Action: `crawl`

The `crawl` action will start at the Input State and attempt to find all URLs reachable from this state. It will then output an Output State for each URL that was found. This action does not have any AI/LLM functionality, so it does not require or accept a natural language `goal`. The `mode` option (as well as the `pattern` option and `limit` option) can be used to specify a strategy for controlling which URLs are included in the crawl.

## Example

This example will crawl the Input State's URL, following only URLs that have the same host (i.e. domain and subdomain) as the Input State:

```json
{
  "action": "crawl",
  "mode": "host"
}
```

## Available Options

(See also the Universal Options in the [Actions](/actions) top-level Documentation)

<OptionsTable
  rows={[
    {
      name: "mode",
      required: false,

      default: '"domain"',
      description: (
        <>
          If "domain" (default): only follow/crawl URLs that share the same main
          domain as the input (i.e. 'indexical.dev' in
          'https://blog.indexical.dev/posts/sonnet_gpt4').
          <br />
          <br />
          If "host": only follow/crawl URLs that share the same host (subdomain and
          domain) as the input (i.e. 'blog.indexical.dev' in 'https://blog.indexical.dev/posts/sonnet_gpt4')
          <br />
          <br />
          If "any": all links are followed.

      description: (

          This can be combined with the 'mode' option.{" "}
          <b>

            followed/loaded, even as intermediate states when crawling.
