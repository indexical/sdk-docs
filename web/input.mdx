# Action: `input`

The `input` action will add [Interactions](/interactions) to the input State that satisfy the provided goal, and then output the new State (with Interactions added).

This action can also be used to 'manually' add Interactions via the `interactions` option.

## Example

```json
{
  "action": "input",
  "goal": "Set the state to be 'California'"
}
```
