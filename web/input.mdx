The `input` Transform modifies the input State to produce an output State with information added about ways to interact with the webpage represented by the input State in order to accomplish the provided goal.

## Example

```ts
import { input } from "indexical/dist/web";

const myTransform = input({
  goal: "Set the state to be 'California'",
});
```

  rows={[
    {
      name: "goal",
      required: true,
      type: "string",
      description: "A natural language goal for the AI to try to achieve.",
    },
    {
