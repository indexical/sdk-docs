## Setting up your environemnt

To run your Indexical projects locally, first make sure that you have included the relevant API_keys in the .env file, as shown below. By default, Indexical workflows use Anthropic's LLM, so make sure to include your Anthropic API_keys. 

```bash .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=""  # OPTIONAL - only needed if you fall back to OpenAI's model for extraction
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="" # NEEDED for any smart extractions
# optional - input if you want to bring your own proxies (otherwise, you can use Indexical's proxies with by running your workflow in our cloud
PROXY_ENDPOINT="" 
PROXY_USERNAME=""
PROXY_PASSWORD=""
```

## `npm run dev`

Runs a file in your Indexical project locally, for debugging purposes.
<Note> When running workflows locally, make sure that you print out the results in the console </Note>

Example:

```typescript runs/sample.ts
import {pipeline} from "../pipelines/sample.ts"

// IMPORTANT: print out the results to the console
pipeline.run(["https://sdkdocs.indexical.dev/"]).then(res => console.log(res)); 
```

```bash
npm run dev runs/sample.ts
```
