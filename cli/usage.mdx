title: "Using the Indexical CLI"

Every Indexical Project comes integrated with the Indexical CLI, for common tasks such as launching runs or fetching results. We recommend using the Indexical CLI using `npm` in your project directory, to ensure the appropriate version of the CLI is being used.

## `npm run dev`

Runs a file in your Indexical project locally, for debugging purposes.

Example:

```bash
npm run dev runs/sample.ts
```

## `npm run deploy`

Run a file in your Indexical project, in the Indexical cloud.

Example:

```bash
npm run deploy runs/sample.ts
```

## `npm run indexical history`

View a list of your account's previous runs, as well as their current status

Example:

```bash
npm run indexical history
```

## `npm run indexical results `

Pull the results of an Indexical run (by ID), as newline-delimited JSON (JSONL). Run ID is visible in the console or when running `npm run indexical history`.

Example:

```bash
npm run indexical results XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```
