Indexical Projects are Typescript projects built on top of the Indexical Typescript SDK. While projects _can_ be created manually, using the Indexical project generator is highly recommended to ensure that projects have the correct structure and the latest dependencies.

## Create a Project

Indexical requires a current version of Node/NPM. To create a new project, run the following command, which will install the project generator (if needed) and create a project with the provided name in the current directory:

```bash
npm create indexical@latest <project-name-here>
```

Provide answers to the prompts that appear (name, description, etc.). Specifically, provide an Indexical API Key (generated from the Indexical Dashboard) if you'd like to run your Indexical project in our cloud.

## Environment Variables

For local testing/development purposes (when running Indexical workflows on your machine or outside the Indexical Cloud), you have the option of providing the following environment variables in the `.env` file automatically generated within your new project:

```bash .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
PROXY_ENDPOINT=""
PROXY_USERNAME=""
PROXY_PASSWORD=""
```

All are optional in general, but the corresponding functionality will fail locally if the environment variable is not set (i.e. OpenAI-based functionality will fail without an OpenAI API Key).

## Create a workflow

Workflows are stored in the `pipelines` directory. Create a new workflow file as shown below. If you'd like to pass in a [Strategy](start/strategies) for extracting a field of data, you can include the name of the StrategyStore as an argument to the relevant WebTransform. In this workflow, the StrategyStore `docs` is passed in to the `extract` transform. 

```typescript pipelines/firstpipeline.ts
import { crawl, extract } from "indexical/dist/web";

/* this workflow will: 
  1. crawl through the first 2 pages on the domain
  2.extract the: 
    a. main title
    b. the content rendered as markdown  
*/
export const pipeline = crawl({
  limit: 2,
}).then(
  extract({
    schema: {
      title: {
        type: "string",
        description: "the main title of the webpage",
      },
      mainContent: "$textContent",
    },
  }, "docs") // strategy-store
);
```

To create the strategy store, add a jsonl file to the relevant subdirectory of the strategies folder. For more information on strategies, see [here](start/strategies). Indexical will first attempt to use that strategy for that WebTransform before falling back to AI-based extraction. 

```jsonl strategies/docs/sample.jsonl
{"key" : "title" , "css" : "h1", "domain" : "sdkdocs.indexical.dev"}
```
## Running a workflow

Then, to run that workflow, we recommend creating a separate file within the `runs` directory. Simply include the URLs for which you'd like to run that workflow as an argument to the run function.

```typescript runs/firstrun.ts
import { pipeline } from "../pipelines/firstpipeline.ts";

pipeline.run([
  "https://sdkdocs.indexical.dev/",
  "https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/",
]);
```

And to run that workflow using Indexical's cloud platform, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm run deploy runs/firstrun.ts
```

You can then check on the status of the run and download the results from the [Indexical Dashboard](https://dashboard.indexical.dev/), or using the [Indexical CLI](/cli/usage).
